**Unit 5: Africa and The World Systems (c. 1000–1800 CE)** <span
id="5"></span> 

*Africa is a vast continent, and many of its regions are located at some
distance from the main trading axes of the world. Nevertheless, African
societies have been deeply integrated into global trends and
transnational systems for long periods of time. Intercontinental
exchange in the Mediterranean dates back thousands of years, and the Red
Sea and Indian Ocean zone have for a long time been sites of trade and
contact. The Atlantic zone (discussed in the next unit) was the last
frontier breached, about 500 years ago.*

*In this unit, we will look at the relationships between Africans and
others in a period that overlaps the time periods covered in units 3 and
4. Part of this unit focuses on religion, as Africa has historically
served as a major site of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religious
heritage and religious practice. We will also look at commerce and the
movement of ideas, particularly in terms of the Mediterranean and Indian
Ocean worlds and their connections to multiple African societies.*
