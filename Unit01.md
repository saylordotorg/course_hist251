**Unit 1: Perspectives on African History** <span id="1"></span> 
*The historian’s primary task is to identify evidence of the past and
assemble this evidence to create narratives or interpretations of what
happened in the past, how it was experienced, and how people talked and
felt about it.  The historian also plays an important public role,
contributing to our contemporary understandings of the past and its
implications for our society.  This means that the historian has to
master complex issues of methodology, theory, and ethics.  The study of
the African past plays a particularly significant role in the
development of both public and academic history for two reasons.  First,
because of the world’s colonial past, African history has been
disregarded and the views of Africans themselves sidelined for a long
time, making the study of African history something of a political as
well as a scholarly act.  Second, since human history goes back so far
in Africa, much of the African past involves preliterate societies. 
Therefore, African historians must make use of many different types of
sources, including linguistics, archaeology, and oral tradition, as well
as written documents, in order to piece together an understanding of
early African cultures.  
  
 In this unit, you will explore the preconceptions that hinder our
ability to understand African experiences in the past.  You will also
get to look at various types of sources that help us reveal and
construct narratives of the African past.  Finally, you will begin to
familiarize yourself with the physical features of the continent of
Africa and the identities of its populations.*

     Instructions: The article linked above was written by a graduate
    student at Howard University.  It frames the argument that African
    history, as it is commonly written and taught, may not effectively
    reflect the needs and worldviews of Africans and African-Americans. 
    It should be read as a position paper, rather than as a fair
    reflection of both sides of the debate.  Please read the article in

    presented at a session of an international conference, with links to
    the poster.  Click on “see paper.”  Much of the information on this
    poster is not relevant to this course.  However, there is a chart in
    the left-hand corner that gives various scholars’ estimates of human
    population levels in Africa over the past 2000 years.  It is
    exceedingly difficult to estimate prior to that period, although
    some questions of demography in earlier periods will be discussed in
    subsequent sections of this course.
