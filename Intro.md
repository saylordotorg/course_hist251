This course will introduce you to the history of Africa from 300,000 BCE
to the era of European imperialism in the nineteenth century. You will
learn about the major political, economic, and social changes that took
place in Africa during this period and examine the experiences of
Africans who lived during this period. You will also explore the
relationships between Africans and people living in other regions of the
world. The course will be structured chronologically except for units 3
and 4, which will divide the continent geographically while covering the
classical period of African history. Each unit will include
representative documents and other resources that illustrate important
overarching political, economic, and social themes. By the end of the
course, you will understand how Africans transformed their continent
beginning with human evolution and concluding with the era of global
capitalism. The story then continues in HIST 252, which covers the last
120 years of African history.

### Course Information

Welcome to HIST251. Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Trevor Getz  
  
 **Course Introduction:** For a long time, professional historians
denied that Africa had a history prior to the arrival of the Europeans.
The process of overturning this misconception has led to certain
peculiarities in the study of Africa’s pre-colonial past, and you may
notice them in this course. For example, we will explore several
assumptions that we make in modern-day society that make it difficult
for us to see how Africans understood and experienced their own lives in
the past. We will also emphasize the many different types of sources and
methods necessary for studying African history in this period outside of
written texts. As you work through this course, think about the ethical
issues that are present in this course and use them to inform your
thinking about the ethics of studying the past in different times,
places, and manners.  
  
 The struggle over Africa’s past has also created difficulties in the
kinds of online resources available to construct a course like this.
Some of the online sites are more emotional and polemical in nature than
they are balanced and scholarly. Others make use of very difficult
technical language to explain sophisticated techniques using multiple
source types. We have tried to find authoritative sources that areas
objective as possible while also remaining accessible to readers, but
you will notice a big difference in the level of readership between
different resources.  
  
 One of the very special resources discussed in this course is the Mande
epic of Sundiata (Sogolon Djata), the first ruler of Mali. Your reading
of this course will be greatly enriched if you manage to get a copy of
the D.T. Niane version of this epic, available quite cheap in most
cases. Additional outside readings available online include chapters of
the UNESCO General History of Africa, which you can search for and find
through your search engine. However, this course is entirely
self-contained and should provide the information you need to gain a
survey-level understanding of pre-colonial Africa.  
    
 **Requirements for Completion:** You must complete all of the assigned
readings and materials presented over the course of each unit, including
the final exam, which can be accessed via the link in the final resource
box in this course. Note that you will be required to create a (free)
account in order to access this final exam unless you have already done
so for another course. In order to pass this course, you must earn a
score of 70% or higher on the final exam.
