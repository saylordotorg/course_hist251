**Unit 4: Ancient and Classical Africa—Sub-Saharan (c. 2750 BCE–1500
CE)** <span id="4"></span> 

*The same drying of the Sahara that concentrated Africans into the Nile
River valley also led to the emergence of sophisticated societies in
sub-Saharan Africa. The first highly structured societies probably
developed in the Sahelian region of West Africa, but over time, the
spread of technologies, the growth of populations, and the development
of trade routes stimulated similar growth elsewhere. Nevertheless, many
African societies chose not to go the route of centralized “states” in
this period, preferring other methods of organization.*

*In this unit, we will look at these societies in all of their
diversity, beginning with a thematic exploration of the origins of
complex states and societies and moving on to an examination of
societies in the Sahel, the forests of West Africa, and then other
regions of Africa in the period before circa 1500 CE.*
