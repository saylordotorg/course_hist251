**Unit 3: Ancient and Classical Africa—The North (c. 2700 BCE – 700
CE)** <span id="3"></span> 
*The earliest and most sophisticated civilization to emerge in Africa in
the early period was ancient Egypt. The ancient Egyptian civilization
emerged in northern Africa along the Nile River around 3000 BCE. It
benefitted from Mesopotamian trade and influence, but also emerged as a
distinct culture. Capable of adapting to the volatile flood cycle of the
Nile River, the ancient Egyptians used sophisticated irrigation
techniques to grow surplus crops. In turn, these surplus crops created
extra resources that fueled social development and culture. The ancient
Egyptians created new trade networks, an independent writing system
based on hieroglyphics, and a strong army to assert Egyptian dominance
throughout the Nile River valley. They also undertook significant
agricultural and construction projects, building monumental temples,
pyramids, and obelisks. Egyptian society (which was comprised of
farmers, artists, craftsmen, and slaves) was highly stratified and was
ruled by a pharaoh and a powerful bureaucracy of elite scribes,
religious leaders, and administrators. Despite the deserts, mountains,
and ocean that surrounded them, Egyptians were not isolated. They lived
in concert with societies of the Mediterranean, Horn of Africa,
Mesopotamia, and Upper Nile.  
  
 In this unit, you will study the complex nature of ancient Egyptian
society and culture, and that of the African societies that surrounded
it. The topics we will look at include daily life, religion, and
political organization. You will also look at the experiences of Greek
and Roman rule in the period following the demise of the pharaonic
state.*

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read chapter 1 for an outline of this period of
    Egyptian history. As you read, consider the following questions:  
        
     ·      What changes in the structure of leadership (from the Old
    Kingdom period to the Middle Kingdom) does the author identify?  
        
     ·      What changes in the social structure does he describe, and
    to what does he attribute them?  
        
     ·      What evidence does the author provide to demonstrate a high
    level of state administrative organization?  
        
     ·      The Hyksos invaders toppled the Middle Kingdom and were
    themselves expelled approximately one hundred years later by Ahmose
    I, founder of the new dynasty. How did the Hyksos invasion and rule
    contribute – directly or indirectly - to the expansion and
    consolidation of the Egyptian empire under Ahmose I and his
    successors?  
        
     ·      What administrative and social changes does the author
    identify as occurring under the new regime?

    terms of trade and cultural exchange?  
        
     ·      To what factors does the author attribute the fall of the
    empire?  
        
     ·      The author uses words such as “middle class,” “feudal,” and
    “feminist” to describe various facets of Egyptian social and
    political life. To what extent do you think these terms might or
    might not be applicable to ancient Egyptian society? Why do you
    think the author might have chosen to use this terminology?
