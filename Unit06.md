**Unit 6: Africans and The Atlantic World (c. 1440 – 1820 CE)** <span
id="6"></span> 

*After 1450, much of Africa was brought into the Atlantic trade system,
increasingly through involvement in the slave trade. Through the
institution of slavery, African lifestyles and cultural practices were
transferred to the New World, where they developed as cultures of
survival, resistance, and production in plantation societies and
elsewhere. The first African slaves brought directly to Portugal arrived
in 1441. As European relations with African rulers expanded, the export
of slaves grew in volume. With the development of plantation agriculture
in the Atlantic islands, and then the Americas, slaves became the
primary component of the coercive labor system. By 1600, the slave trade
was the most lucrative element of European trade with Africa. Between
1450 and 1850, about 12 million Africans were shipped to plantations in
the Americas.*

*In this unit, you will study the complex and brutal nature of the
Atlantic slave trade. We will also take a look at the indigenous slavery
of West African kingdoms, European commercial interests in Africa, the
relationships between African rulers and European traders, and the rise
of New World slave societies.*

        Buala.org cites a number as high as 100 million?
    -   What reasons does Buala give for not forgetting the impact of
        slavery on Africa?
    -   According to these resources, what were the primary reasons for
        the enslavement of millions of Africans?
    -   Why do you think some people might highlight or ignore the role
        of the African elite in the slave trade?
