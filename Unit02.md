**Unit 2: Peopling the Continent (c. 265,000 BCE­–1000 BCE)** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Human life began in Africa, and human evolution has much to do with the
African environment. Because of its great ecological and climatic
diversity, Africa forced human populations to adapt to many different
environmental settings. As the second largest continent in the world,
Africa was host to diverse groups of hunter-gatherers. Before the end of
the Ice Age (approximately 10,500 BCE), many groups lived in the
interior or coastal highlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Then, the effects
of the Ice Age transformed the Sahara into a fertile valley that
attracted bands of hunter-gatherers. Five thousand years later, however,
the rapid drying of the Sahara drove many peoples eastward, where they
made permanent or semi permanent settlements in the Nile River valley.
Two key factors led to the onset of the Agricultural Age (the emergence
of sedentary farming communities): the domestication of cattle and
donkeys around 6000 BCE and the rapid drying of the continent around
4000 BCE, which forced peoples to settle in more tropical regions. The
introduction of new ironworking techniques during the so-called Iron Age
affected these new agricultural societies; by 500 CE, metalworking was
commonplace in East and West Africa.  
  
 In this unit, you will look specifically at human interactions with the
African environment over a very long period of time. You will study the
impact of climatic change upon hunter-gatherers and agricultural
communities. You will also consider how agricultural innovation,
metalworking, and commerce transformed the nature of early African
civilizations. Finally, you will see how these technologies spread
around the African continent, helping Africans respond to challenges and
take advantage of opportunities.*
