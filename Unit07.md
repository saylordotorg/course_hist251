**Unit 7: Capitalism, The Industrial Revolution, and Africans (c. 1652 –
1890 CE)** <span id="7"></span> 

*Despite the damage caused by the Atlantic slave trade, Africans had, by
the late eighteenth century, constructed diverse, cosmopolitan,
functioning societies across the continent that interacted with one
another as well as with trading partners and co-religionists around the
world. Historians often look to the 1890s and the formal colonization of
Africa as the end of this diversity and independence. However, African
independence was arguably first threatened during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. During this period, industrial revolution created
massive productivity imbalances between western Europe and other parts
of the world. Africans were conscripted or recruited into global trade
as producers of raw materials, rather than as manufacturers of finished
goods. As a result, Africa generally lost wealth while western Europe
gained it. This had a massive impact on the economic (and ultimately
political) independence of African societies.*

*In this unit, we will explore the industrial revolution and its impact
in Africa, and examine the ways that Africans participated in it. We
will also look at two specific situations—the production of oilseeds
(palm kernels and peanuts) in West Africa and the settlement of southern
Africa—that serve as particularly advanced examples of this process.
Finally, we will explore the situation in Africa on the eve of
colonialism.*
